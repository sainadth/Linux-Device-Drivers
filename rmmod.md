# rmmod (rEmOVE modULE) Command Execution Sequence

This document explains the internal steps involved when the `rmmod` command is used to remove a Linux kernel module.

## Command Usage
```bash 
sudo rmmod <module_name>
```

## Execution Sequence

1. **rmmod**:
   - User-level command that parses the module name and invokes the `delete_module` system call.

2. **delete_module**:
   - Transfers control to the kernel.
   - Calls the `sys_delete_module` (counterpart for `delete_module` in the kernel) function.

3. **sys_delete_module**:
   - Verifies permissions to ensure the user has the right privileges to remove the module.
   - Checks if the module is in use by any processes or other modules.
   - Delegates the core removal logic to `free_module`.

4. **free_module**:
   - Unlinks the module from the kernel's module list.
   - Frees the memory allocated for the module's code, data, and other sections.
   - Cleans up any resources, threads, or functionality that the module was providing.
   - Resolves any remaining references to the module.

5. **Remove References from Linked List**:
   - Updates the linked list of loaded modules to remove the unlinked module.
   - Ensures that the kernel's internal structures no longer reference the removed module.

6. **module_exit**:
   - Calls the module's exit function (defined using the `module_exit` macro) to complete the cleanup.
   - Finalizes the removal of any remaining resources or state associated with the module.
