# Linux-Device-Drivers
# insmod Command Execution Sequence

This document explains the internal steps involved when the `insmod` command is used to load a Linux kernel module.

## Execution Sequence

1. **insmod**:
   - User-level command that parses the module and invokes the `init_module` system call.

2. **init_module**:
   - Transfers control to the kernel.
   - Calls the `sys_init_module` function.

3. **sys_init_module**:
   - Verifies permissions to ensure the user has the right privileges to load the module.
   - Delegates the core loading logic to `load_module`.

4. **load_module**:
   - Allocates memory for the module's code, data, and other sections.
   - Resolves any unresolved symbols required by the module.
   - Validates the module to ensure it is properly formatted and compatible with the kernel.
   - Links the module into the kernel's module list.

5. **Add References to Linked List**:
   - Registers the module in the kernel's internal structures.
   - Updates the linked list of loaded modules, which is used for tracking and dependency management.

6. **module_init**:
   - Calls the module's initialization function (defined using the `module_init` macro) to complete the setup.
   - Initializes any resources, threads, or functionality the module provides.

### Key Notes
- Each step ensures the module is safely and efficiently integrated into the kernel.
- Errors or failures in any step result in the module being rejected and appropriate logs being generated.
